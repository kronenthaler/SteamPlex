# SteamTV

Launch [Steam Big Picture Mode](http://store.steampowered.com/bigpicture/) directly from [Plex](http://www.plexapp.com).

## Installation

1. Rename repository folder or duplicate thereof to `SteamPlex.bundle`
2. Copy to `~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plugins`
3. Launch it from the Application menu item in Plex
4. Wait a while for Big Picture Mode to launch, it's kinda slow to get started
